NAME
----
oblsc - Capture signals to a Value Change Dump (VCD) using the Open
        Bench Logic Sniffer

SYNOPSIS
--------
*oblsc* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Oblsc is a command line utility to capture logic signals to a Value
Change Dump (VCD) using the Open Bench Logic Sniffer. It was written
in order to have a simple command line client for the Open Bench Logic
Sniffer which does not require Java nor a graphical environment.

Oblsc has a powerful language for defining trigger conditions which
does not require the user to define the conditions at the level of
hardware registers in the Open Bench Logic Sniffer. Oblsc
automatically configures the hardware's channel groups to maximize
memory depth and sample rate.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h, --help*::
     Show usage help.

*-C, --config*='FILE'::

     Specify a configuration file. If not specified oblsc looks for a
     file named oblsc.rc in the XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory according to
     the XDG Base Directory Specification (normally ~/.config/). See
     the CONFIGURATION section for configuration file details.

*-D, --device*='DEVICE'::

     The device of the Open Bench Logic Sniffer. The default is
     '/dev/ttyACM0'.

*-B, --baudrate*='BAUDRATE'::

     The baudrate to use for communicating with the Open Bench Logic
     Sniffer. The default is '115200'.

*-t, --trigger*='TRIGGER'::

     Specify a trigger, see the TRIGGER section for details on the
     syntax.

*-r, --trigger-split*='<percent>% | <time>'::

     Specify the number of samples to keep before the
     trigger-point. The amount can be specified as a percentage of the
     total sample store or as a time (See the TIME section for details
     on the valid time units). The default is 0%.

*-S, --sample-rate*='HZ'::

     Specify the sample rate in Hz. The suffixes k and M are
     understood. The default is 100MHz.

*-f, --filter*='true/false (1/0)'::

     Control the use of the input filter module. It is enabled by
     default.

*-e, --external-clock*='true/false (1/0)'::

     Control the use of the external clock. It is disabled by default.

*-i, --invert-external-clock*='true/false (1/0)'::

     Control if the external clock is inverted. By default it is not
     inverted.

*-o, --output*='FILE'::

     By default the resulting VCD is written to stdout. If this option
     is used it is written to FILE instead.

*-s, --signal*='<name>:<chlist>'::

     Define an input signal named <name> which consists of the input
     channels in '<chlist>'. A '<chlist>' is a comma separated list of
     channel numbers ([0-9]+) and/or channel spans. A channel span
     consists of two channel numbers separated by a '-', i.e. '10-13'
     which is a shorthand for '10,11,12,13'.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Oblsc uses a freedesktop.org key file (see the Desktop Entry
Specification) to specify default values for some of the command line
options. A command line parameter will override the value in the
configuration file if both are given. A commented sample file is
provided with the oblsc distribution. The following parameters are
understood:

.Configuration file parameters
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Group|Key|Equivalent command line parameter
|device|device|`--device`
|device|baudrate|`--baudrate`
|clock|sample-rate|`--sample-rate`
|clock|external-clock|`--external-clock`
|clock|invert-external-clock|`--invert-external-clock`
|capture|filter|`--filter`
|capture|split|`--trigger-split`
|=======================


TIME
----

When time intervals are specified they can be specified as either a
specific number of samples or as a time. If no unit is given the
number is parsed as a number of samples, oblsc understands the units
`s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns` and `ps`. If the time, as specified, differs by
more than ten percent from the actual time as used by the hardware (in
samples) oblsc will print a warning.

TRIGGER
-------

* Grammar

A trigger specification has the following grammar:

 <triggers> ::= '(' <sequential_triggers> ')';
            |   '{' <parallel_triggers> '}';
            |   <delayed_trigger>
	    ;

 <sequential_triggers> ::= <sequential_triggers> ',' <trigger>
                       | <delayed_trigger>
		       ;

 <parallel_triggers> ::= <parallel_triggers> ',' <trigger>
 		     |   <delayed_trigger>
		     ;

 <delayed_trigger> ::= <trigger> '/' <time>
		   |   <trigger>
		   ;

 <trigger> ::= <timed_trigger>
 	   |   '[' <pattern_triggers> ']'
	   ;

 <timed_trigger> ::= <name> '=' '[' <timed_values> ']';

 <timed_values> ::= <timed_values> ',' <timed_value>
 		|   <timed_value>
		;

 <timed_value> ::= <value> '/' <time>;

 <pattern_triggers> ::= <pattern_triggers> ',' <pattern_trigger>
 		    |   <pattern_trigger>
		    ;

 <pattern_trigger> ::= <name> '=' <value>;

 <value> ::= "0x"[0-9a-fA-F]+
 	 |   "0"[0-7]+
	 |   [0-9]+
	 ;

 <name> ::= [a-z][a-z0-9]*

* Semantics

A sequence of _sequential triggers_ will start the capture when all
members have triggered.

A set of _parallel triggers_ will start the capture when at least one
of its members has triggered.

A _delayed trigger_ will delay the start of the capture following a
trigger match by the specified time delay.

A _pattern trigger_ allows capture to start when the input signals
have a particular state.

A _timed trigger_ starts a capture when an input signal has been at
the given state for the specified time interval.

Note that although the trigger specification language allows timed and
pattern triggers to be mixed, trigger expressiveness is usually pretty
limited as the hardware is limited to only four registers for encoding
triggers.

EXAMPLES
--------

To capture the one bit signal _clock_ on channel zero together with
the four bit signal _data_ (with channel four being the most
significant bit) on channels four to one to the file
'/tmp/capture.vcd' the following command could be used:

----
oblsc -s clock:0 -s data:4-1 -o /tmp/capture.vcd
----

If we want the capture to start when _data_ has been 0 for 10ns we
would add a trigger:

----
oblsc -s clock:0 -s data:4-1 -t "data=[0/10ns]" -o /tmp/capture.vcd
----

To start the capture when _data_ is 0xF and _clock_ is 1 we would use:

----
oblsc -s clock:0 -s data:4-1 -t "[data=0xf,clock=1]" -o /tmp/capture.vcd
----

FIRMWARE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------

Oblsc will only work with the v2.12 FPGA bitstream and with PIC
firmware versions >= 2.0.
